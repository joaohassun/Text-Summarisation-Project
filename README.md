# Text-Summarisation-Project
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a powerful solution for condensing complex financial documents into coherent, accessible summaries. This project explores the application of a domain-specific summarisation model fine-tuned on the EDGAR-CORPUS Financial Summarization dataset, which includes U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings paired with expert-written summaries. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, the model demonstrated consistent learning improvements—reducing training loss from 4.48 to 3.55 and validation loss from 4.15 to 3.29. Final performance yielded a BERTScore F1 of 0.82, reflecting strong semantic alignment with reference summaries.

The summariser produces variable-length outputs in either bullet-point or paragraph form, retaining financial terminology and numerical fidelity while enhancing readability. It performed well in summarising lengthy documents such as 10-K filings, streamlining financial analysis and improving accessibility for stakeholders including investors, analysts, and regulatory professionals.
The project also addresses key challenges in generative summarisation: factual reliability, hallucination risk, and model interpretability—critical issues in high-stakes financial contexts. To ensure scalability, the model was designed for low computational overhead, enabling deployment on standard hardware without reliance on external APIs.

In addition to financial applications, the summarisation framework has potential in broader business contexts such as internal reporting, customer feedback synthesis, and policy documentation. Future work could include reinforcement learning with human feedback and further tuning for numerical consistency and fluency. By combining technical depth with practical utility, this project contributes to the evolving landscape of domain-specific generative AI. It offers applied and theoretical insights for researchers, developers, and decision-makers seeking robust, responsible AI solutions in enterprise communication and intelligence.
